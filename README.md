A basic website with an about, portfolio, and contact page for myself, Jake Dudum. The about page contains a selfie of me and a short bio. The portfolio page currently contains placeholders to be replaced with actual projects over time. Lastly, the contact page contains a basic form for submitting name, email, and a message, but currently does nothing with it. Additional functionality and further design improvements will be made over time.
